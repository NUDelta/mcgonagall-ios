# RPPT iOS
Authored by [Kevin Chen](http://kevinchen.ninja), 2015.

Master repository located at [remote-paper-prototype-testing](https://github.com/NUDelta/remote-paper-prototype-testing). See that README for more extensive physical setup information.

## Requirements
This iOS application should work out of the box, though it has not been tested for < iOS 8.0. Do any sort of device provisioning as needed.

## Icons
*from the Noun Project*
* Refresh by Mani Cheng
* Close by Leyla Jacqueline

## Usage
Enter in the sync code displayed on the web control center to start the stream of the paper prototype. Any gestures (tap + pan) you make will be overlayed on the web stream.

You can stop the stream by hitting the `x` in the top right and reconnect (or to a different session) by clicking the `Resync` button in the center.

Any task updates are displayed below the video stream.

## Next Steps
Enterprise or App Store release and in-app server URL customization are features that will eventually be worked on.
