# McGonagall iOS

iOS component of the [McGonagall](https://github.com/NUDelta/mcgonagall) project. See that README for instructions as how  to setup the entire architecture.

## Requirements
Developed for > iOS 9.3.

## Usage
Enter in the sync code displayed on the [Wizard Control Center](http://rppt.meteorapp.com) to connect to the Meteor app and obtain a stream of the paper prototype. A stream of the iOS app screen will then be published to the Control Center and any gestures (tap + pan) will be overlaid on that stream. You can connect to another stream by resyncing.
